(Spin Version 6.4.3 -- 16 December 2014)
	+ Partial Order Reduction

Bit statespace search for:
	never claim         	+ (never_0)
	assertion violations	+ (if within scope of claim)
	cycle checks       	- (disabled by -DSAFETY)
	invalid end states	- (disabled by never claim)

State-vector 36 byte, depth reached 131, errors: 0
 33593277 states, stored
 20155223 states, matched
 53748500 transitions (= stored+matched)
        0 atomic steps

hash factor: 127.852 (best if > 100.)

bits set per state: 3 (-k3)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
 1281.482	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
  512.000	memory used for hash array (-w32)
  512.000	memory used for bit stack
    0.382	memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)
 1024.577	total actual memory usage


unreached in proctype safer
	(0 of 154 states)
unreached in claim never_0
	safer.pml:243, state 11, "-end-"
	(1 of 11 states)
